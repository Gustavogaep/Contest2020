My teachers say, school is the process in which we are to grow,

My teachers say, school is the students time to glow,

My teachers say, school is the greatest transformation we know,

But it is time for the students to say no.

 
It is time that these misguided institutions

Come face to face with the fact that they are not the solution

But there is still a chance for resolution

Which should begin with this current dissolution.
