Education, the real power tool of peace
Education, where the future of peace lies
Educate the people where ever it lacks
Through values imbibed the human success.

Education, the real motivational aspect
Where qualities of mind will in positive ways
Channel the energy of human mind right ways
The toll is really the corrective steps
The steps that is built in education no doubt.

A virtuous life through values of education
A virtuous life through valuable thoughts
Where humans have to complete the journeys
Through attaining and earning peace for ever.
